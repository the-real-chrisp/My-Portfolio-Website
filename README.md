# My Portfolio Website

## Description

This is my portfolio website to showcase who I am, the work that I’ve completed, and my contact information for prospective partners to reach out. This website is my bridge between my past accomplishments and future opportunities. By designing this website, I’ll showcase my work in a way that a traditional resume can’t. Throughout this project I continued to challenge my knowledge of HTML and CSS. I’m always open to new challenges so please reach out if you’d like to collaborate!
